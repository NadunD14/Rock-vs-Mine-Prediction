# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Rock Classification using Sonar Data - Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on predicting the type of object (rock or mine) using sonar signal data with a Machine Learning approach. The dataset contains numerical, unlabeled data representing sonar returns, and the classification task involves distinguishing between rocks and mines.

Key Features:
Dataset: The sonar dataset, which consists of numerical features representing sonar return strength, is used for training and testing.
Algorithm: Logistic Regression is employed to train a classification model.
Objective: Classify unlabeled sonar data into categories (rock or mine) based on the trained model.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps are applied to prepare the dataset for effective training.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.
This repository contains the implementation, including data preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation code, along with explanations of key steps.

Getting Started:

1)Clone the repository.

2)Run the provided scripts to preprocess the data and train the model.

3)Test the trained model with the provided test dataset.
